BUG:

- put explanation on resume.
- test on IE (fix bug with form input rendering)

MINOR ADDITIONS:
- ratings could also be removed by the user if he wants to.
- fix bug no data is in the applicants table.
- trim out white spaces in references etc...

MORE ADDITONS:

>> need SSL certificates, look into gchecky: http://code.google.com/p/gchecky/wiki/TutorialForLevel2
- use Google Chart APIS (http://code.google.com/apis/chart/) for rough statistics of applicants (countries of admitted applicants, background ...)
- automate emails sent to accepted / rejected / waiting list applicants.
- lightbox (modal box) for signups.
