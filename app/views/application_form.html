        <p>We have a limited number of <strong>scholarships</strong> to cover travel and/or registration expenses. These will be awarded preferably to accepted applicants who would not be otherwise able to attend (e.g. from developing countries, or departments with limited travel budgets). Acceptance to the summer school will be judged independently of financial need. If you wish to apply for financial support, please tick the checkbox and provide the following additional information.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Your <strong>referee must provide a paragraph</strong> in their letter of recommendation justifying the need for financial support.</li>
        
        <li>Please give an <strong>estimate of the amount required</strong> (fees + travel expenses - amount available from other sources) below.</li>
