1) Download the latest tar ball: http://github.com/alexksikes/mlss/tarball/master.

2) tar xvzf "the tar ball"

3) Download install webpy, follow instructions here: http://webpy.org/install.

4) Setup lighttpd, here is a part your config file:

    ...

    name = "mlss_admin"
    script = "path to ./application.py"

    server.document-root = "path to ./public/"

    # make sure users can access the application forms but not the admin
    $HTTP["url"] !~ "/(submit_application|submit_reference|css|img|js)/?" {
        auth.require = ( "" =>
        (
           "method" => "digest",
           "realm" => "Authorized users only",
           "require" => "valid-user",
        ))
    }

    url.rewrite += (
        # Commented for development
        #"^/img/(.*)$" => "/img/$1",
        #"^/css/(.*)$" => "/css/$1",
        #"^/js/(.*)$" => "/js/$1",

        "^/resumes/(.*)$" => "/resumes/$1",
        "^/(.*)$" => script + "/$1",
    )

    fastcgi.server += ( script =>
    ((
        "socket" => "/tmp/" + name + var.PID + ".socket",
        "bin-path" => script,
        "check-local" => "disable",
        "max-procs" => 1,
        "bin-environment" => (
            "REAL_SCRIPT_NAME" => ""
        ),
    ))
    )

    ...

5) Setup your database: mysql -p mlss < ./schema.sql. Note you first need to create a database called mlss.

6) Make sure lighttpd has write access to the directory ./public/resumes/
You'd do something like this: sudo chgrp www-data ./public/resumes; chmod 775 ./public/resumes;

7) Go over your site settings ./config_example.py and rename this file ./config.py

8) Restart lighttpd and you're done.
