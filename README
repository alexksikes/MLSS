This is the system we used in order to process the vast number of applicants for the machine learning summer shcool (MLSS) at Cambridge. 
This code has been made available open source so it could be re-used for subsequent summer schools.

Read INSTALL on how to install and PAYMENTS_INSTRUCTIONS on to how process payments.
